# Typing game
This is a typing speed and accuracy game remake using tkinter windows. There are 4 gamemodes: 15 words, 30 words, 10 seconds, and 30 seconds. There is now instant feedback, so the letters turn green or red if you get it right or wrong. Also, only two lines of words, 10 words on each line, is shown at a time.
To run it, install dependencies and run type.py.

## Auto
To run use sudo -E python auto.py
Press esc to end the program and just click the start button in typing_game.py for it to work.

## Words
The words are taken from a generated 1000 word sample from the nltk library. The way the csv file of words are generated is in generate_words.py
